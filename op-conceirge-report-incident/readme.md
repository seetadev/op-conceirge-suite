# BlockScout: Enhancing Developer Experience using Blockscout API. 

We are using  Blockscout API to get the source code and ABI of a contract. 

We are then generating UML Diagram by passing the contract source code to sol2uml to generate a UML diagram. 

We are then integrating the generated UML into OP Concierge suiteâ€™s user interface and using it for contract analysis and verification.
