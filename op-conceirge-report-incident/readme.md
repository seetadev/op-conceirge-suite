# BlockScout: Enhancing Developer Experience using Blockscout API. 

We are using  Blockscout API to get the source code and ABI of a contract. 

We are then generating UML Diagram by passing the contract source code to sol2uml to generate a UML diagram. 

We are then integrating the generated UML into OP Concierge suiteâ€™s user interface and using it for contract analysis and verification.

# BlockScout API for developing Contract Deployment Dashboard

We are developing a feature in the OP Concierge Suite that allows users to deploy and verify contracts, showing real-time status updates and providing links to Blockscout for detailed inspection.

Please visit our initial attempt at https://github.com/seetadev/op-conceirge-suite/tree/main/op-conceirge-report-incident/blockscout-smart-contract-verifier
