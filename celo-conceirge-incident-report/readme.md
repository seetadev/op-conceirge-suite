 Real-Time Incident and Ticker Reporting:
   - Decentralized Reporting: Allows clients to report incidents and tickets instantly using a secure, blockchain-based platform. This ensures that incident data is immutable and can be accessed by relevant Concierge authorities in real time.
   - Immediate Notifications: Sends real-time alerts and notifications to users and emergency services about ongoing incidents, helping to coordinate timely responses.


 Smart Contract Deployment:
   - DApp Development: The OP Concierge Suite deploys its smart contracts on the Celo blockchain. These contracts could manage tasks such as invoicing, work orders, customer incidents, vehicle auctions, and more.

   - Testnet Deployment: We have deployed the dApp on the Alfajores testnet for testing and refinement, and attempted deployment on the Dango testnet to ensure compatibility across Celo's test environments.
